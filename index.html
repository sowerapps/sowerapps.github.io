    <p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 1in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sower
      Applications is a set of applications designed for theological studies.
      ThML Viewer, and Sower are the primary programs. ThML Viewer is designed
      to work with ThML files, while Sower is designed to work with modules that
      have been built from ThML files. Sower has some advantages over ThML
      Viewer because it uses Sower Modules for primary content. Sower Modules
      are mapped files, with special interfaces for retrieving tables of
      content, media (which can be streamed from the modules), scripture,
      commentary, and dictionary entries, etc. Sower, and ThML Viewer both have
      the features that you would expect such as search routines, bookmarks
      (with personal notes), history list, etc. AutoDef windows monitor mouse
      movement and attempt to identify information that may be applicable to the
      text at the mouse position and display scripture references, commentary
      and dictionary entries. AutoDef windows can have AutoDef windows so you
      can follow a chain of information. Fast search routines (with boolean
      operators such as 'AND', 'OR' and 'NOT") for searching an entire library,
      or individual books.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 1in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In
      addition there are tools for creating theme, and translation files for the
      software. Tools for building, inspecting, and installing modules. Tools to
      create ThML files from html files, and also to create a ThML file from
      epub books. And a tool to assist in editing ThML, and html files. There is
      also a librarian to maintain a library of modules. A map editor for
      creating a list of hot spots on an image that can be used by AutoDef to
      view information from installed dictionaries that is relevant to the
      location at the hot spot. And with these tools you can create and publish
      your own books.</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 1in; margin-right: 1in;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sower
      Applications is free, cross-platform and runs on linux, windows, and mac.
      And although it is designed specifically for theological studies you can
      create a library for any genre that interests you.<br>
