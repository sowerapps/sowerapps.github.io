    <p>Sower Applications is a set of applications designed for theological
      studies. ThML Viewer, and Sower are the primary programs. ThML Viewer is
      designed to work with ThML files, while Sower is designed to work with
      modules that have been built from ThML files. Both have the features that
      you would expect such as search routines, bookmarks, history list, etc.
      AutoDef windows monitor mouse movement and attempt to identify information
      that may be applicable to the text at the mouse position and display
      scripture references, commentary and dictionary entries. AutoDef windows
      can have AutoDef windows so you can follow a chain of information. Fast
      search routines for searching an entire library, or individual books.</p>
    <p>In addition there are tools for creating theme, and translation files for
      the software. Tools for building, inspecting, and installing modules.
      Tools to create ThML files from html files, and also to create a ThML file
      from epub books. And a tool to assist in editing ThML, and html files.
      Also included is librarian to maintain a library of modules. A map editor
      for creating a list of hot spots on an image that can be used by AutoDef
      to view information from installed dictionaries that is relevant to the
      location at the hot spot.</p>
