      Sower Applications</h2>
    <p>Sower Applications is a set of free applications that fall into 3
      categories.</p>
    <div style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-align: left;">
      <ul>
        <li>Theological studies.</li>
        <li>Tools for users to edit themes, user interface translation files,
          and configuration files for the software.</li>
        <li>Tools for creating modules.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sower Applications are cross-platform and are currently available for
        MSW, and Linux. The primary applications are Sower, and ThML Viewer
        which are very similar programs. The primary difference is that Sower
        uses pre-built modules for it's library source, while ThML Viewer uses
        ThML files. And both feature:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Bookmarks with personal notes, and text selections.</li>
        <li>Fast search routines, full library, and individual books.</li>
        <li>History list.</li>
        <li>AutoDef (Automatic Definition) which pulls up links, and also
          monitors mouse and caret position in an attempt to identify
          information that maybe useful to the user and displays the results in
          a scrollable window above, or below the mouse pointer, or caret.
          AutoDef windows can have AutoDef windows allowing users to follow a
          chain of information without ever navigating from the page that is
          currently displayed.</li>
        <li>Presentation, while content is the most important part of any
          document presentation matters. Sower, and ThML Viewer attempt to
          present documents as closely as possible to the original.</li>
        <li>A plug-in architecture that allows for improvements, and new
          features to be added to the software without having to modify the
          original software.</li>
        <li>And more ...</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </body>
